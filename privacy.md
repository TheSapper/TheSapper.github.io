# Privacy Statement
>*"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."*  
>Article 12, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UN.

I am a private person and, as I expect other people to respect my right to privacy, I respect theirs. This means you, as a visitor to my site, can expect me to make every feasible effort to ensure that any data collected during your visit is minimal, secure, and the methods are transparent. To that end, this page will detail the collection and use of your data in full.

## Tracking
This website will respect your current "Do Not Track" (DNT) setting. DNT is a privacy preference you can set in your browser to prevent ad networks and other online services from collecting and sharing information about your web browsing behaviour. To learn more about DNT, visit the [Electronic Frontier Foundation's website](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track).

## Usage Analytics
I do not currently measure usage of my website. This may change in the future, but it's unlikely.

## Site Hosting
This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can view their privacy statement [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement). In particular, [this part](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement#github-pages) relates to how your information is collected by them when you visit my website. I have no access to any data collected by GitHub.

## General Statement
Since removing Google Analytics from my website, I can safely say I am not collecting data about you or your visit. However, should you find that there is any data being erroneously collected, or if you have any questions in general, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/InfosecSapper/InfosecSapper.github.io/issues/new).
